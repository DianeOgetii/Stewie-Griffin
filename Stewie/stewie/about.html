          "Stewie" Griffin is a fictional character from the animated television
          series Family Guy. He was supposedly born on September 11th 1998. He is
          the youngest of Peter and Lois Griffin, the youngest brother of Meg and
          the younger brother of Chris. Initially obsessed by world domination, He
          is a highly precocious todler who acts as an adult. He has also come to
          have a very close friendship with his anthropomophic dog Brian and his toy
          Rupert. Stewie has won the show multiple awards with his wild imagination
          and hillarious cut aways. He is my best character in that show.
